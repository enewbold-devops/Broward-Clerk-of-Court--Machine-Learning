Case Event Tokens & Bigrams: PySpark ML Model 
  (Event on Cases ranked for a Judge and Case Charges)
  Engineered  By Alan Newbold, BSEE  data@e-newbold.com

What your notebook computes (quick map to code)
  •	Scope window: It limits events to the 180 days before disposition for each case (the WINDOW_DAYS = 180 logic).
  •	Token source priority: It builds a single text field per event, preferring EventDocuments → Description → (optionally) other text, cleans it (e.g., removes eFile: and |), uppercases & trims, then treats that as a token (one token per row/event).
  •	De-dup per case: For token stats, it uses presence of a token in a case (unique (Case_Number, token)) rather than raw frequency—so one case can’t overweight a token by repeating it across many events.
  •	Attach outcomes & group: It joins each (Case, token) to case-level attributes/outcomes, then groups by (Judge_Name, Current_Offense_Description, Current_Offense_Statute)—i.e., “Judge × Charge”.
  •	Baselines per group: For each Judge × Charge group it computes the baseline favorable rate p_fav.
  •	Conditional rates per token: For each token it computes
      p_fav_given_token = fav_cases_with_token / cases_with_token.
  •	Lift ranking (tokens):
      lift = p_fav_given_token / p_fav.
      Then it ranks tokens within each Judge × Charge by:
      1.	lift (desc), 2) p_fav_given_token (desc), 3) fav_cases_with_token (desc), 4) cases_with_token (desc).
        It also enforces stability filters: min cases per group and min cases with the token (e.g., MIN_GROUP_CASES = 10, MIN_PATTERN_CASES = 3).
        •	Bigrams: It sequences events by EventDate per (Case, Judge, Charge), computes next_token = lead(token), forms bigrams as "token | next_token", de-dups per case, then repeats the same baseline/conditional/lift logic and ranking as for tokens. Bigrams also use the same stability filters and top-K per group capping.
 
Model and interpolate “ranked tokens”

Think of each token as a case-level indicator: “Does this case include at least one event whose normalized description matches this token in the 180-day window?”
For each Judge × Charge group:
  •	Baseline favorable rate p_fav: the rate of favorable outcomes across all cases in the group.
  •	Token conditional favorable rate p_fav_given_token: the rate of favorable outcomes among cases that had this token.
  •	Lift:
      o	> 1.0 ⇒ association with higher than baseline favorable outcomes.
      o	≈ 1.0 ⇒ little/no association.
      o	< 1.0 ⇒ association with lower than baseline favorable outcomes.
  •	Counts to trust signals:
      o	cases_with_token (support). Low support tokens are noisy—even with high lift—so your MIN_PATTERN_CASES guardrail is crucial.
      o	fav_cases_with_token (confidence in the direction of effect).
    	
Interpretation tips

  •	Prefer tokens with lift > 1 and decent support.
  •	Compare two tokens with similar lift—trust the one with more cases_with_token.
  •	If a token has huge lift but appears in just a few cases, treat it as a hypothesis worth validating (possible artifact).
 
Model and interpolate “ranked bigrams”

Bigrams capture order: “After event A, the very next event is B” within that 180-day window. For each case, a bigram is only counted once (presence), even if repeated.
For each Judge × Charge group:
  •	Compute the same trio: p_fav, p_fav_given_bigram, and lift for the bigram.
  •	Rank by lift, then conditional rate, then supportive counts.
  
Interpretation tips

  •	Bigrams often surface micro-playbooks (“MOTION FILED → CONTINUANCE GRANTED”, “DISCOVERY → SUPPRESSION HEARING”), i.e., procedural sequences linked with outcomes.
  •	As with tokens, favor bigrams with reasonable support. A rare sequence with extreme lift can be spurious.
    Why “presence per case” (not raw frequency) matters
  •	Prevents overcounting: One case with many repeated “CONTINUANCE” events shouldn’t dominate.
  •	Aligns with “playbook” intent: you care whether the playbook element appeared at all—not how many times.

Common pitfalls & guardrails

  •	Multiple comparisons: You’re testing many tokens/bigrams. Use support thresholds, and consider adding:
      o	Empirical Bayes smoothing (shrink extreme lifts with low support).
      o	Confidence intervals for lift (e.g., Wilson/Agresti–Coull on proportions, then propagate).
      o	Fisher’s Exact Test or log-likelihood ratio (G²) as a secondary significance screen.
  •	Simpson’s paradox: You’re already conditioning on Judge × Charge, which reduces confounding. Keep it.
  •	Data leakage/time: You correctly restrict to pre-disposition events only.
  •	Token quality: Normalize aggressively (strip boilerplate, standardize common phrases), merge synonyms, and avoid “catch-all” tokens (e.g., “DOCUMENT”) that add noise.
    Review of  top-K tables
    
Each row (token or bigram) within a Judge × Charge group should include roughly:

  •	total_cases (group size)
  •	cases_with_pattern (support)
  •	fav_cases_with_pattern (favorable support)
  •	p_fav (baseline)
  •	p_fav_given_pattern (conditional)
  •	lift
  •	rank (1..K after stability filters)
  
Quick rules of thumb

  •	Rank 1–3 with lift ≥ 1.25 and cases_with_pattern ≥ 8–10 → strong leads.
  •	Lift 1.05–1.20 with cases_with_pattern ≥ 20 → mild but reliable association; consider as supportive context.
  •	Lift < 1 → potential risk indicators or “anti-playbooks” (useful for avoidance).
  
Suggested enhancements (if you want to iterate)

  •	Smoothing: Add a Beta prior:
      p^fav∣pattern=fav_cases_with_pattern+αcases_with_pattern+α+β\hat{p}_{fav|pattern} = \frac{fav\_cases\_with\_pattern + \alpha}{cases\_with\_pattern + \alpha+\beta}p^fav∣pattern=cases_with_pattern+α+βfav_cases_with_pattern+α 
      and recompute lift with p^\hat{p}p^. Choose weak priors (e.g., α=β=1\alpha=\beta=1α=β=1).
  •	Uncertainty: Attach 95% CIs for lift (e.g., by delta method or bootstrap).
  •	Alternative ranks: Keep lift as primary, but compute PMI for bigrams (on case-presence) or log-likelihood (G²) to prioritize surprising/cohesive sequences.
  •	Semantic normalization: Cluster near-duplicate tokens (e.g., “ORDER GRANTING CONTINUANCE” vs “CONTINUANCE GRANTED”) to reduce fragmentation.
  
Using the outputs

  •	Per Judge × Charge “playbook cards”: Show top tokens and top bigrams with lift, conditional rate, and support.
  •	Triage view: Color-code by lift (>1 green, <1 red), dim if support < threshold.
  •	Drill-through: Clicking a token/bigram lists the cases (and event timelines) that triggered it—useful for qualitative review.
  •	Vectorize for RAG in Azure AI or OpenAi for inferencing and fine-tuning against reasoning from vectorized case events data for Attorney guidance on cases with charges presided on a particular Judge (Coming Soon In the next ML Model)
